<p><b><u>RED CARD TO REQUEST HELP</u></b></p>
<p>Firstly, and probably most important of all, we want to look after our neighbours. 
Your neighbours and our volunteers will be checking on everyone to make sure we are all safe. 
If everything is okay (you don't have to, but could put something green at your window); 
BUT if you need help, please put something RED against your window where people can see and 
someone will come to check on you. Anything red, (tea towel, t-shirt etc) will let us know, 
you need support (If you feel comfortable, also write your phone number in the window so 
that someone can call you). If we all do this, we can all help each other through these 
'unprecedented times'. If you see a RED signal but are unable to help, please call 
07795071741. We can deliver a red card through your door if required. Please call the Clerk. 
Thank you and Keep Safe.</p>
